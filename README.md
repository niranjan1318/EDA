**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato Dataset  Project Overview**

This project performs** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Zomato restaurant dataset with a focus on country-wise analysis. The notebook explores restaurant ratings, online delivery availability, customer voting patterns, and distribution of ratings across countries—especially India and the UAE.
The goal of this analysis is to understand customer behavior, restaurant performance, and geographical trends using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

** Dataset Description**

The dataset contains information about restaurants listed on Zomato, including: - Country - Restaurant ratings - Votes - Online delivery availability - Price range - Customer feedback indicators. 

Key Analysis Performed


**1. Rating Distribution Analysis**
•	Identified rating categories such as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Average, and Poor
•	Observed that most ratings fall between 2.5 and 3.4
•	Large number of restaurants are marked as “Not Rated”

**2  Country-wise Rating Insights**
•	India contributes the highest number of zero and “Not Rated” ratings
•	Rating behavior varies significantly across countries

**3. Votes & Customer Engagement**
•	Analyzed voting patterns in relation to ratings
•	Higher-rated restaurants generally receive more votes
**4. Online Delivery Analysis**

•	Online delivery is mainly available in India and UAE
•	Other countries show limited or no online delivery services

**5. Statistical Distribution**
•	Used Gaussian (Normal) distribution to understand rating spread
•	Identified skewness caused by unrated and low-rated restaurants

**Visualizations Used**


•	Bar charts for rating counts
•	Histograms for rating distribution
•	Country-wise comparison plots
•	Curve plots to explain Gaussian distribution

These visualizations help convert raw data into clear, actionable insights.

**Tools & Libraries**
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	Jupyter Notebook

**Conclusion**
This EDA provides valuable insights into restaurant ratings, customer behavior, and regional trends in the Zomato dataset. With additional interactivity and deeper feature analysis, this project can be expanded into a strong portfolio or academic data analysis project.
